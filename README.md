# student performance analysis 
🔸 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing student academic performance data to identify key factors affecting results, visualize trends, and extract actionable insights. It uses data analytics techniques and Python-based tools to perform data cleaning, visualization, and predictive modeling.

🎯 Objectives
To analyze and understand patterns in student performance data

To identify correlations between performance and parameters like gender, study time, parental education, etc.

To visualize trends using interactive plots

To build basic prediction models for performance classification (optional)

🛠️ Tech Stack
Language: Python 3

Libraries:

pandas for data handling

matplotlib and seaborn for visualization

scikit-learn (optional for ML tasks)

numpy for numerical operations

Jupyter Notebook or .py scripts


📊 Key Features
📌 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

📈 Correlation heatmaps and feature distribution graphs

📊 Visualization by gender, parental level of education, test preparation course, etc.

🤖 (Optional) Simple ML model to predict performance class (low, average, high)
